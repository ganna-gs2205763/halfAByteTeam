# AccelAid

## What it does:
It aids teachers during the process of accelerating learning by using AI to generate personalized study plans, study materials, and assessments for each student.

## Instructions for installing the project:
Since the app includes Firebase, it cannot be posted on a public GitHub repository. For us to be able to post it on our public repository, we had to delete many key APIs. Therefore, the app will not run efficiently.

## Instructions for running the project:
Use VSCode and Flutter and Dart extensions to run the app, as well as Android Studio emulators.
